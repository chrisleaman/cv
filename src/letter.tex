\begin{letter}{Geoff Cooper\\Ports and Harbours Manager\\Klohn Crippen Berger\\Vancouver, Canada}
\opening{Dear Geoff,}

A mutual colleague, Nicole Anderson (Klohn Crippen Berger, Calgary), recommended that I contact you directly in regards to any open Port and Harbour Engineer positions which might be open.

I am currently working as a Ports \& Marine Structural Engineer for KBR in Brisbane, Australia and am looking to relocate to Vancouver at the end of this year. I believe my current experience would be an ideal match for your group. Below is a brief summary of experience:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ports \& Maritime Engineer with six years Australian consultancy experience
\item Experienced with design of reinforced concrete and structural steel in the context of ports, wharves and retaining walls
\item Limited experience in coastal and hydraulic modelling
\item Previous clients include Australia ports, city councils and international oil and gas companies
\item Site construction experience at the Port of Townsville, Australia
\item Graduated 2010 with Bachelor of Engineering (Extended Majoring in Civil Engineering) with Honors
\item Proficient with finite element analysis software and programming (Excel VBA, Python)
\item Eligible for P.Eng after a year of work in Canada
\item Eligible for Canadian work visa
\end{itemize}

I will be visiting Vancouver from August 1st to 8th and would love the opportunity to meet for a coffee or interview to discuss potential opportunities.

% I am currently working in engineering consulting as Coastal and Maritime Engineer, where I have been involved with coastal and flood modelling as well as the structural design of port and marine infrastructure for the past six years.

% Over time, I have found the aspects of my job I am most passionate about are developing software to perform analysis on large amounts of data.
% I have been involved with simulations of dam operating strategies, wave and mooring analyses, and flooding risk analyses.
% I am at the stage where I have the core skills to provide these specialist services, but I am looking to increase my expertise in this area.

% I am a quick learner and can offer experience relating to the maritime industry.
% I am especially excited about the diversity of projects at Polymathian and hope that I can be involved with the company.
% As I do not currently have code to present as an example of my work, I am happy to demonstrate my skills with a small project of your choosing.

% I have five years experience working with a large engineering consultancy and have been performing data analysis as part of my role within the maritime and coastal engineering field.
% I am keen to get more exposure to challenging big data applications and I see this position as the perfect role to help me achieve this.
